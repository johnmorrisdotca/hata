// data-door.ts: the family's data door, as one file of types and four small functions. The same file in every package that takes outside data (src/data-door.ts), copied unchanged from
// kazoku-ui's templates/; a repository never edits it, and scripts/check-standard.mjs fails when a copy differs. A copy, not an import, so that a package with no runtime dependencies keeps none.
// No DOM, no three.js, no clock, no network of its own: a source does its own fetching, and this file only checks, counts, budgets and words what a source says.
//
// The idea: a package draws, and the caller supplies the data. Outside data comes in through a source, either records (a list that fits in memory) or tiles (data cut by place and by detail,
// fetched only for what the view shows). Every source carries its licence and credit in code, so a view can always say whose data is on screen. With no source a package draws what it drew before.
//
//   validateSource(source, taken)       throws a TypeError for an empty credit, no licence name or link, a bad id, a clashing id, a missing function
//   creditLine(credits, language)       "Yale Bright Star Catalogue (Public domain); UCAC4 (CC0 1.0)."  with "non-commercial" or "share-alike" whenever the source says so
//   loadRecords(source, signal)         reads a record list once, freezes it, refuses more than MAX_RECORDS, skips and counts records with a non-finite number
//   createTileStore(options)            loads tiles by key under a byte budget: at most 6 in flight, least recently used out first, never a tile the view needs, failures counted
//
// The shapes are in DESIGN-831 (MODULES-831). The licence terms of a caller's source may be non-commercial or share-alike; a package's own (bundled) sources never are.
